# Recovery - LAHacks submission

## Welcome to Recovery!

### Inspiration

### What it does



### How we built it

We used Python to pull information about a food's nutrients from the openfoodfacts and FoodData Central APIs. With this data, we and created functions that would keep track of nutrient intake and also calculate how much a person needs based on sex and weight. 


### What we learned

* Front-end and back-end workflow
* How to deploy backend to Google App Engine
* 

### Challenges we faced

* Nutrient unit conversion from differences in APIs
* Managing state in React
* Initially had low success rate for barcode-image recognition
* Handling and sorting from messy databases

### Accomplishments we're proud of

* Consistent barcode detection through cropping & image post-processing

### What's next for Recovery

* 

### Built with:

* Python
* JavaScript (React.js)
* Postman
* Google Cloud
* Figma
* Docker
* Netlify
